🔍 E-Commerce Data Analysis: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights! 📊

Analyzed an E-Commerce dataset using SQL and Excel to extract insights on customer trends, payment methods, top products, and seasonal sales. The project highlights how data analysis can drive business strategy and decisions.

Data analysis isn't just about numbers—it’s about transforming raw data into meaningful insights! I recently worked on an E-Commerce Transactions dataset from Kaggle, leveraging SQL & Excel to extract key business intelligence.

🔹 Steps I Followed:
✅ SQL Queries: Filtered, aggregated, and analyzed customer transactions, payment methods, and revenue trends.
✅ Excel for Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, standardized formats, and removed duplicates.
✅ Pivot Tables & Charts: Built dynamic summaries for revenue by country, payment method, and product category.
✅ Interactive Dashboard: Designed a visually engaging report to uncover purchasing trends, seasonal patterns, and top-selling products.

📌 Key Insights:
📈 Middle-aged customers contribute 58.65% of total revenue.
💳 Cash on Delivery & UPI are the most used payment methods.
🛍️ Toys & Electronics dominate sales based on transaction count.
📆 July & December show the highest revenue spikes!

💡 Takeaway: Combining SQL for data extraction with Excel-based analytics helps businesses optimize strategies and enhance decision-making. 🚀
